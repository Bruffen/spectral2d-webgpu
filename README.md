### TODO
- ~~Create a main class;~~
- ~~Simplify variable names in their own class;~~
- ~~Make light uniform work;~~
- Make common screen quad vertex shader;
- Do bounds collision;
- ~~Do sphere intersection.~~
- Do triangle intersection.
- Make light move to mouse click position
- Implement other types of lights

### Ideas
- In order to avoid requiring float32-filterable, try using a compute shader.
